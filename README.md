|-fileSaving.js (download)

|-package-lock.json (only shows up once npm packages are installed)
â—Ÿ-script.lua (download)
```
## Step 2 - Run Command Prompt
In command prompt run this
```cmd
cd Downloads\Incognito
npm i express fs copy-text-into-clipboard
node fileSaving.js
```
## Step 3 - Run Roblox with Incognito
